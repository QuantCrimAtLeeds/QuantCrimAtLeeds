<H2>Predictive Policing</H2>
<P>
Predictive Policing attempts to use the past patterns of crime to estimate where new crimes will be. This may be based just on the location and time of an offence, or may take more complex issues, such as the type of environment, into account. In general, these methods develop a map of probable locations of crimes over a short (weeks) future timespan.

<P>
We work to both improve predictive algorithms and assess their accuracy and ethics.
