The Quantitative Criminology group is co-convened by <A href="http://www.law.leeds.ac.uk/people/staff/lightowlers/">Carly Lightowlers</A> and 
<A href="https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/people/n.malleson">Nick Malleson</A> and aims to bring together those with an interested in crime related research with methodological expertise in analysing quantitive data. The aim of the group is to create a supportive collegial environment in which to share research findings and gain feedback  on work or project ideas that may still be in progress.
